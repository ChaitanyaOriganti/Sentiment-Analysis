# Sentiment-Analysis-API
Objective:
  
    This project builds an API that analyzes text sentiment. It takes text input, predicts its sentiment using a machine learning model, and returns the results. 
  
Dataset:

    You can find the training dataset in arline_sentiment_analysis.csv file.
  
Project:

 To create a sentiment analysis API, you'll build a binary classification model, develop a Python API server using the Pyramid framework, implement sentiment-predicting APIs, use OOP for model training and inference, integrate Swagger documentation, and provide a report on model experimentation and tuning. A video showcasing API calls and JSON responses will complete the project.
